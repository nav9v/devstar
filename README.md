# ⭐ Disposable Chatroom Project - Team 74 ⭐

Our team, Team 74, developed a disposable chatroom using Svelte and the GunDB library. Users can enter a room name and a username to join a chat room. Within the chat room, users can send messages, delete messages, and, at the end, any user can dispose of the room by clicking the delete button.
